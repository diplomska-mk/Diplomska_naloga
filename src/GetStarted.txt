Prerequirements:

1. Install JDBC driver from Microsoft:
	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server
 
2. Install HTML cleaner:
 	http://htmlcleaner.sourceforge.net/download.php
 	
3. Install JSOUP HTML parser:
	https://jsoup.org/download
	
4. For all (1)-(3) add .jar files to the java path

5. For all (1)-(3) add .jar as external jars in the build path of the project 

6. Is not existing, create SourceData/The Conv folder in the workspace


Working principle:

DownloadPage.java main function is the main function of the project.
An example news portal is The Conversation (https://theconversation.com/uk) and has a defined enum 
For a defined category (must be in CategoriesTheConversation enum), the main function of the DownloadPage.java
gets all articles and locally saves the source .xml files. The only for loop then parses each .xml file and 
returns article content. The parsed article content is also saved locally.
To use for a different news portal a new enum must be defined foloowing the structure of CategoriesTheConversation.
Comments/function calls for functions that should be added are provided in the for loop.

DataBaseConnection.java provides for examples on how to establish a connection with the database, execute a query 
and a stored procedure without output parameters.

Good luck ;)
